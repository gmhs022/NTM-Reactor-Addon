Addon for NTM, currently a heavy work in progress with no actual content.

Planned content:

Small Modular Reactor (Think Zirnox with PWR coolant system and running off simple reactor dynamics)

Dark Matter Reactor (Based on the logic of my Roblox game "Prototype DMR Simulator", 1-4 "catalyzer" fission reactors feeding into a central fusion reactor with PA-based particle capsules feeding 

Probably more
